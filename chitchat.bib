  abstract	= {This paper proposes a strategy to improve the quality of
		  chatbots interactions by dynamically and automatically
		  learning new information to deal more appropriately with
		  new discourse domains. We show some experiments in the
		  school learning domain where our chatbot, named
		  {\$}{\$}r{\$}{\$}rAVA, was able to, after reading a book,
		  not only respond correctly to many questions presented by
		  the students but also to formulate its questions regarding
		  the book's content to the students}
